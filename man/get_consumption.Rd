\dontrun{

# First you need a token
id_client <- "XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX"
id_secret <- "XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX"
token <- get_token(
  key = list(id_client = id_client, id_secret = id_secret)
)

# Then you can retrieve consumption data
consumption <- get_consumption("short_term", token = token)
